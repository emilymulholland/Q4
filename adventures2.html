          <p>It’s very possible to get a smidge of primatologist Jane Goodall’s experience without making gorillas your life’s work. On Abercrombie & Kent’s 5-day Tailor-Made Uganda: Bwindi Impenetrable Forest journey, you’ll pick your adventure pleasure, whether you want to penetrate the lush-beyond-belief Bwindi “Impenetrable” Forest National Park in search of its resident tribes of gorillas, or tour the children’s wing at the local community hospital with A&K Philanthropy.When you see your first gorilla, remember it’s not King Kong: gorillas are typically sweet-tempered, even a bit bashful.</p>
